# Epidemic_DataSet_Analysis_Phase1

Import the project in suitable Java development platform, Import all the dependencies given in the dependency folder. 1. To execute task1 src\asu\mwdb\phase1\task1 contains implementation of task1. CreateEpidemicWordDic.java calls the main method for task 1. Give 4 arguments: 1. resolution, 2. windowLength, 3. shiftlength, 4. the directory of epidemic simulation file. The epidemic word files will be written to the folder called epidemic_word_file

To execute task2 src\asu\mwdb\phase1\task2 contains implementation of task2. CreateAvgAndDiffFiles.java calls the main method for task2. Give 3 arguments:
alpha,
location matrix file,
path of the epidemic simulation word dictionary files i.e path of the epidemic_word_file folder obtained in task1.

To execute task3 src\asu\mwdb\phase1\task3 contains implementation of task3. CreateHeatMap.java calls the main method for task3.

Give 4 arguments: 1. Input simulation file, 2. path of the directory of the one of the output folders (choice of the user ()), 3. the location matrix, 4. the output directory for heatMap
